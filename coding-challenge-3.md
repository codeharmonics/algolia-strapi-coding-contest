## Solve a problem! 
Company ABC needs a new search experience. They want you to revamp their existing search screen. 

Their only requirement is that it includes [Autocomplete](https://autocomplete.algolia.com/). Everything else is up to you - they want it to be a great search experience.

### The contest

Here's the company's current app, which includes autocomplete:

https://codesandbox.io/s/algolia-autocomplete-js-v1-sandbox-f316g

There are two parts to this app: The UI and the Data.

#### For the UI

We'd like you to implement an **instant results, autocomplete experience**, which means that users see results instantly as they type. 

Here are some inspiring examples:
- [docs](https://www.algolia.com/doc/)
- [docsearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/)
- [Sandboxes](https://autocomplete.algolia.com/sandboxes)

Take a look at this [article on how to implement Autocomplete](https://www.algolia.com/blog/ux/taking-documentation-search-to-new-heights-with-algolia-and-autocomplete/).

#### For the data 

Our sandbox already contains data, which you can use and focus only on making a great UI. 

Or you can use different data: You can plug in your own service and add one or more different sources (GitHub API, YouTube API, Algolia, Locations, etc.). 

### Happy coding!
