## Solve a problem! 
Company ABC needs a new search experience. They want you to revamp their existing search screen. 

Their only requirement is that it includes Autocomplete. Everything else is up to you - they want it to be a great search experience.

Here's their base app, which includes autocomplete:

Here are some examples of great search that includes autocomplete:
- docs
- docsearch
- customers 1
- customers 2
- customers 3

These are just for inspiration. It's up to you to build the experience that you think is best for the company.

There's a lot of coding to do but also design! We want you to make the functional and decision decisions! We therefore need your left and right brain - This is front-end coding at its best!

**The functional** - you need to decide on the features: add facets, paging, menu - Algolia's features are all yours to do what you want.
**The design** - once you've got the features, it's up to you to place them on the screen and style them. Make up your company's logo and colors and then try to fit the search into their brqand.
**The code**. It's time to implement.
