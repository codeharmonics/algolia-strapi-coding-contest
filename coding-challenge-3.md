## Solve a problem! 
Company ABC needs a new search experience. They want you to revamp their existing search screen. 

Their only requirement is that it includes [Autocomplete](https://autocomplete.algolia.com/). Everything else is up to you - they want it to be a great search experience.

### The contest

Here's the company's current app, which includes autocomplete:

https://codesandbox.io/s/algolia-autocomplete-js-v1-sandbox-f316g

To participate:
- Fork this sandbox
- Make all coding changes in your forked version
- Submit the final version of your sandbox

There are two possibilities: A great UI or multiple data sources.

#### Create a great autocomplete UI

We'd like you to implement an **instant results, autocomplete experience**, which means that users will see results instantly as they type. 

For this, you can use the data that's already already plugged into the sandbox.

Here are some inspiring examples:
- [docs](https://www.algolia.com/doc/)
- [docsearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/)

Take a look at this [article on how to implement Autocomplete](https://www.algolia.com/blog/ux/taking-documentation-search-to-new-heights-with-algolia-and-autocomplete/).

#### Plug in multiple data sources 

If you'd like to focus on the data, you can plug in your own service and add different data sources (GitHub API, YouTube API, Algolia, Locations, etc.). 

For this, you will be judged on the creativity you have in managing multiple data sources and results. However, you will need to make sure your UI propoerly displays the mulitpe data sources.

You can find out more about combining multiple sources in our guide on [federated search](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/solutions/ecommerce/autocomplete/tutorials/federated-search/).


### Happy coding!
