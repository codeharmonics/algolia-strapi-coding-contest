## Principles

We have a booth at the Strapi conference on April 22nd.
We want an animation for the booth.
We came out with the idea of a coding contest.
Participants can pick the category then want. 
For each category, the prize is the smartphone of their choice (give them choice Iphone 12, Pixel 5, Samsung) OR a giftcard for the value of $1k.
The contest starts on April 22nd and ends on Sunday, May 2nd at midnight pST.
The winners will be announced by Friday, May 7th.
Each participant gets a coupon code.
